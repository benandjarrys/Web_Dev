# **Prospective Midterm Plan**

##Concept
 Create a blog that voices deep/ unconventional thoughts 
 and ideas that people feel when they’re not at their best.
 As I learn to manipulate the UX more, I want to create a page 
 that allows for comments so that people may help one another 
 deal with the situations or concerns expressed.
